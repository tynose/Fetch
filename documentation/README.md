### Premise
fetch aims to keep your all of your pets information in a organized app. This 
information can be accessed by any service that may require it to perform their services
i.e. grooming, international borders, kenels, etc...


### Description
Fetch allows you to sign up/login to a specific profile for your pet.  Witihn this profile you can list various things from eating habits, when they were recently groomed, age, sex, type of dog, picture, etc.... An aditional feature that is being implemented into the app is your animals vet records.  This information is accessed by sending a request to either a vet that you recently visited, or have visited in the past.  A special key will sent by email and will allow the vet to view a specific form on the website to be filled out. Once finished by the vet, your fury friends records will now be available to whoever may need them.
